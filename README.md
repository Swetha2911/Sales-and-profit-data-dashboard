📊 Sales and Profit Data Dashboard

This project is a Sales and Profit Data Dashboard designed to provide clear insights into business performance. It helps visualize sales trends, profit margins, and key performance metrics in an interactive and user-friendly way. The dashboard makes it easy to track revenue growth, compare sales across categories, and analyze profitability over time.

By leveraging tools like Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and Streamlit (or Excel/Power BI, depending on your tech stack), the dashboard turns raw sales data into actionable insights that support better decision-making.

Key features include:

📈 Sales Trend Analysis – view performance over days, months, or years.

💰 Profit Tracking – monitor margins and profitability by category.

🗂️ Category & Region Breakdown – understand which products or regions drive the most growth.

⚡ Interactive Visualizations – explore data dynamically instead of static reports.
